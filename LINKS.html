    <ARTIcle>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[9] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic.[10][11] As of 31 August 2020, more than 25.3 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 848,000 deaths. More than 16.6 million people have recovered.[8]

        Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[12][5][6][13] While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,[14] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.[15][16][17] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.[5][18]</ARTIcle>
